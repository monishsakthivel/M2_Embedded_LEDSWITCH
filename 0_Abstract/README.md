  Squinting of LED is a basic venture in Embedded programming world. There are multiple approaches to making a flickering LED circuit. You can make one utilizing transfers. You can make one utilizing semiconductors. Or on the other hand you can make one utilizing parts like an inverter, a 555 Timer or a microcontroller. Here switch is utilized to squint the two LED utilizing ATmega328(a microcontroller).
